## About

RMM is an open-source light-weight program to manage your accounts on **Dofus Retro 1.33.6**.

Initially based on a simple 100 lines file, it has now more than a couple thousand of it, adding features like a **GUI**, an **account profile** system, a **customizable scenario system**, and many more... (see list of features below for an expanded list).

It is developed with the sweet [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) scripting language.

## Warning

This software is **not a cheat** and **never will be**. Its only purpose is to play the game with multiple accounts easier than what is currently offered by the game itself. If you are looking for something that plays the game for you, you are not in the right place.

## Limitations

Because it uses predefined position to perform actions, RMM is currently only available for these resolutions :

- 1360x768
- 1366x768
- 1600x900
- 1920x1080
- 2560x1440
- 2560x1600
- 3840x2160

If you have another resolution, you will have to gather cursor position from Dofus menu, please do as follow :
1. Download our tool [GetPos.exe](https://github.com/DetroitApps/RetroMultiManager/tree/master/Tools/GetPos "Tool GetPos") and save it on your desktop.
2. Execute it.
3. Open your Dofus instance and maximise the window.
4. Place your mouse cursor on the exact middle of the login input, then press "Print Screen" key (keyboard).
5. Reapeat the same actions for every server's slot (after login page).
6. Press "Echap" to exit the application.
7. In "resources" folder, fill "ConnectPlayersOnServer.ini" and "LoginAccounts.ini" with gathered mouse position (see generated logs from GetPos.exe).
8. Contact us to add the resolution natively in RMM.
